1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,500
Failure? What is that? 

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,300
Oh right, I've heard about that. 

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,300
It's such a simple, such a clichÃ© thing. 
You can't succeed without failure. 

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,400
For me venturing on is hopefully a lifestyle. 

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:32,300
It's this idea of constantly discovering, constantly being 
curious and constantly hoping that the road has no end.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,400
I'm curious about things. I'm curious about the world, 
about different cultures, about different kinds of people, 

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,300
and it's my curiosity and my selfishness of 
wanting to find that out about myself, 

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
that drives me to do new kinds of projects. 

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm very lucky though that I've been able to build 
an audience that goes on that trip with me.

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,500
In some ways I like to be very prepared and study and learn 
about it and figure out what my point of view is going to be. 

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,300
But I also don't want to know too much. 

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:12,400
I kind of always approach it in two ways, being somewhat 
prepared and somewhat ready just to be surprised.
