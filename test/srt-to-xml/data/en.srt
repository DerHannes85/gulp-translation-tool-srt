Snowboarding is my world. It is my joy, it’s a creative outlet.
A way I scare myself and stretch myself – snowboarding means everything to me.

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:44,500
You know the halfpipe is the most technical of all the snowboard styles and for me,
when I’m able to just launch big straight airs with stylish grabs, that feels amazing.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I’m very familiar with night shoots, but shooting with this type of visual effect,
where it’s an infinity image, a constant loop. It was definitely a treat.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:12,500
My olympic medals are a symbol of me reaching goals and performing at the highest ability
that I can. But it also is not defining of me, as a sports woman, as a person.

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was able to drive the Panamera Sport Turismo today and it was such a pleasure.
To feel the power with the accelerator not even half down was pretty spectacular.

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:57,000
And the fact that you can have that sports feel with a car, where you can have kids
or friends in the back or throw my snowboard in the back – that is pretty special.

You don’t have to sacrifice the sport and driving excellence for space.
